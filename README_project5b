stat.h
fcntl.h
sysfile.c
fs.c


In stat.h, 
  we add T_CHECKED and unchar checksum variable to be avaiable to use in other file

In fcntl.h,
  we defined O_CHECKED flag as 0x400

In sysfile.c,
  add type checking for T_CHECKED in create() and sys_open() function.

In fs.c,
  - bmap() function, we masked the address with 0x00ffffff in both direct and indirect node if type is T_CHECKED.
  - stati() function, we compute and dump the info of checksum value if it is T_CHECKED type 
  - readi() function, we compute  the checksum again and check with the stored value. if it match, return 0 and if not, return -1
  - writei() function, we create the block for checksum and write it on the filesystem.
